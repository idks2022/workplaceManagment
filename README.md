# workplaceManagment

An app streamlines the registration of employees, departments, and shifts synchronically where each object is connected to the others by reference.
The app is secured using JWT authentication.

Tech stack: Node.js and Express.js with RESTful architecture to allow the interaction with the data sources:

  MongoDB - holds the collections of employees, departments, and shifts.
  
  Webservice - holds the pre-registered users and is used for authentication upon login requests.
  
  JSON file - for logging all the requests to the server for the use of the system manager.

  
A simple UI was developed using HTML and vanilla Javascript.
